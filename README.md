### <b>Prerequisites</b>
1. Knowlege of Python

### Dataset
With the right dataset alot of exciting works can be done. Once we have interesting data we can use Python, Pandas and matplotlib to analyze or visualize the data. If the dataset is provided in scv or json file, its easy to work on it directly otherwise we have to search for dataset first.
<br> Mostly we find the dataset we are looking for, but there is no way to download it. This is where BeautifulSoup comes in handy to scrape the HTML. BeautifulSoup is used to analyze online data and bring the data in a structure, we can understand it. <br>
